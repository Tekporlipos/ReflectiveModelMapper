# ReflectiveModelMapper
ReflectiveModelMapper: Effortlessly map data between Java model classes using reflection. Streamline mapping operations with automatic field mapping and support for nested objects.

# ReflectiveModelMapper

ReflectiveModelMapper is a comprehensive and feature-rich Java utility designed to simplify and automate the process of mapping data between different model classes. It leverages the power of reflection to provide a flexible and efficient solution for handling complex data transformations.

## Features

- Automatic mapping of fields between source and destination objects.
- Support for nested objects, enabling seamless mapping of complex object hierarchies.
- Compatibility checks and type conversions to ensure data integrity during the mapping process.
- Customizable mapping logic, allowing developers to extend and tailor the utility to specific mapping requirements.
- High performance and efficiency, even with large and complex object structures.
- Intuitive API and comprehensive documentation for easy integration and usage.

## Getting Started

To use ReflectiveModelMapper in your project, follow these steps:

1. Download and include the ReflectiveModelMapper code in your project.
2. Create an instance of the `ModelMapper` class.
3. Invoke the `mapToEntityOrDto` method, passing the source object and the destination class.
4. Receive the mapped destination object as the result.

ModelMapper modelMapper = new ModelMapper();
TariffPlanDTO tariffPlanDTO = new TariffPlanDTO();
// Set properties for tariffPlanDTO...

InternetPackageDTO internetPackageDTO = new InternetPackageDTO();
// Set properties for internetPackageDTO...
internetPackageDTO.setTariffPlan(tariffPlanDTO);

- InternetPackage internetPackage = modelMapper.mapToEntityOrDto(internetPackageDTO, InternetPackage.class);
-- System.out.println(internetPackage);

Please note that the code provided is a sample implementation, and you may need to adapt it to fit your specific project structure and requirements.
## Advanced Usage

ReflectiveModelMapper provides advanced features and customization options to cater to diverse mapping scenarios:
###  Custom Converters

You can implement custom converters to handle specific mapping logic or conversions. Simply extend the Converter interface and register your converter with the ModelMapper instance using the registerConverter method.
### Mapping Strategies

ReflectiveModelMapper allows you to define custom mapping strategies by extending the MappingStrategy interface. This enables you to control the mapping behavior, define custom field matching rules, or handle specific mapping scenarios.
### Handling Circular References

The utility handles circular references in object hierarchies by keeping track of already mapped objects. It avoids infinite recursion and ensures accurate and consistent mappings.

For detailed usage examples and more advanced features, refer to the documentation provided with the ReflectiveModelMapper library.
